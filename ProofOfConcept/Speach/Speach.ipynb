And work once again to investors edge on gary culp i'm your host a thanks for being with us today glad you here ladies and gentlemen happy that you are listening. It's april 10th. 2023 it is monday. And let me just start off by saying. At the end of each show. We do a little. Go home hug your family. Hug your children. They will feel better. That you will feel better. We started saying go home and hug your children. The day of the columbine incident. Columbine incident the columbine murders. I i. How many years ago was that hold on columbine. April 20th 1999. For almost. 4 years. I have been ending the show. The same way. I don't want to get into why and it has nothing to do with my family. But. Hint. As often as you can. As often as you want. Make sure your family and your kids. Know how you feel about. Has nothing to do i'm not mentioning it because of my family. Just. I'm mentioning it because of. A families that i know. Okay. Right out of the box. And since we mentioned 1999. Oh that was the year that the bubble. Of a. Set the stage for the worst bear market. I think in history for the nasdaq that dropped 80% nasdaq 180%. I out in 1999. And since then. We have stated to you. Oh several thousand times. When all is said and done. Watch the semic. We're getting right into the crux of something here ladies. This is what i've been saying to you. Forever. Since 2000. I would suggest to you. That 90 some odd percent of the time. It's not a hundred. Watch the semic. They have been amazing. Leaders to the upside. And leaders to the down. And what i mean by that is. Kind of simple. You can't have a real bull market. Without the sem. Now it used to be. Financials. And then it went to financials. And semiconductors. After 08. We were able to back out. The financials. Because during 08. 0708. The market rallied without them. And then of course. They let the crash. In a way. One of our best calls in history. Was it '07 that whole year. We would just say to you something was wrong with the financial. When the market i remember the down rally the thousand points. And the financials couldn't bu. The big financials. With the dow rally 1,000 points. And then when the dow came in a thousand. They let down and let down badly. And then when the market would rally up a little bit. They were hesitant. So they had this. They lost the leadership quality. But they showed us the way. I'm a little did we have no idea. That disaster lied ahead. We had no idea. Merrill. Bear ste. Countrywide financial wachov. Who else went out. Back. We have no idea. You know who did have an idea. The market. But since. It's pretty much the semis. And when we say lead. Very simply. They hold up best. In good markets and corrections. When they crack. It will be indicative. Of the rest of the market. The eventuality. Of the rest of the market. And you don't have to believe me. If you have some stock software. That you can just go back my softwares allows me to go back. Daily weekly and monthly. To the beginning of time. I can change the date. And all i can tell you as i have done this study. I don't think the word is uncann. I just think. How it is. And and why would that be. Well semiconductor chips. Everything. Almost everything. And they have basically moved the needle. And why am i bringing them up today what what matters so much today. Well this morning. Very simply. Nasdaq was getting smacked around. And as you know the nasdaq's pretty important. To the market as. And guess what the semiconductors did. And guess where they did it. Well. Number one. They help. What happened then. Market follow. Where do they hold. What is the most important. Area. We have harped. Forever. Because it's simply works. That area. Where. The big institutions. Stand up. To defend. The 50-day moving average. And as i go through. Name after name after name after name. Name after name. After name. After name. Afternoon. A bunch of semiconductor stocks today. Along with the semiconductor index. Held. The 50-day moving average. To the penny on some names. The semiconductor index. Undercut it by two points. By the way. Two points. On an index that's over 3,000. And they bounced. Slash rallied up. And market. Got better throughout the day now does this mean. They're going to get going no we didn't say that. We just said they held. Important area. And again. Market follow. And a nasdaq that was getting blasted early. Came back and followed. Now we got to see. Whether they decide to. Bust out of range. If they do. Market's going to be better. If they don't. Maybe they sit around. If they break below. Today. And it's lowe's. Could be of import. So just letting you know. When we give out the final numbers. There wasn't a lot of big movement today. Except for this area. When we give out the numbers. Will let you know that the institutions. Boston market up. In the last 10 minutes. Interesting. What did they notice. What did they react to. The semic. Again. Once again. Amazingly so. And we'll see where it decides to take us. It does not mean we get going. Would just letting you know that today. Today. The market recognized it. Understood it. Got better throughout the day. And finished on the. I think the high note of the day. And that's the story. And we do our webcast. And we do our scans. It's amazing. How we look at photo albums. Looking for familiar faces. And those familiar faces continue to show up. Up next today's market rap. And anything else i'm gary this is the one only investors edge.

It's time to switch on the integrator units and get the brain cells working you're listening tooth once again all right today's market.com. No gray areas with the man you're either in or out of the market was proprietary indicators go check it out. Investment. Dashmodels.com now i'm going to give you out the final dow first. It was only up 100. But i have to tell you. It was. The whole day. It was never more than 60. In the last 30 seconds at r. 60 points to be up a. Write the clothes. At the s&p only finished up for. And of course that same thing. The nasdaq finished down three. Finish down three. At the low today the nasdaq was 11924. It's not 157. These socks at the low today was $3,042. The 50-day moving average 3044. It finished the 3126. Up 55. Just improvement throughout the whole day. The semis. And let me be clear about how this works. These big institutions will recognize. When something's being defended. Or something is cracking. That's the strength. That's our edge. That's what happened today. Does it mean anything for tomorrow. Well since we don't have a real big trend. Not yet. But you never know if it starts. And if you look at the semiconductor index you will notice. On march 13th it undercut. The 50-day moving average and got back above. On march 15th. It hit the 50-day moving average within two points. On march 28th. Got within 15 points. On thursday hit it within a few points and today the same. That is what we call. Symmetry. What does that mean symmetry. Oh it's simply means that. There is a recognition of. Support. And keep in mind the 50-day moving average is not stagnant. It is a moving target. As price moves up the 50-day moving average moves up as price moves down. The the opposite. And what the 50-day moving averages you just adding up the last 50 days the closes. Get your number divide by 50 and it's a smooth out. Versus all the squiggly wigglies. Of the daily moves. And all we can tell you is through. History. And then we're going back ages. It is the definable area. And when i was scanning throughout the day i found. 15 to 20 of the semiconductor names that tagged it and bounc. Tagged it and bounc. And then there was some other names outside of the semis that tagged it. And bounce. Will it continue. We'll see. Success. Today. That's what happened today and i say that with the nasdaq down three nasdaq 100 down 11. But as i said the nasdaq was down 160 something. Early in the day. So we're going to chalk this up. To a very good day. And if. Nas. As we enter earnings can break above. The last seven days. That would be muy importante. Same for the nasdaq 100. Same for the s&p. All sitting in tight action right here. And we're not even going to say what odds favor. We'll just react if it happens. That's all we wanted to do. And what's our edge. 99.9% of wall street doesn't follow this. And even if they did they wouldn't know what to do with. As as we've told you wall street is fully invested vehicle. Fully invested vehicle. Come heck or high water. Watch the guy on tv today come out. Oh i'm bullish i'm buy. Wait a minute. Even 100% invested. You have no cash how you buying. Oh i'm going on tv so i got to tell people on both but you're in bullish all the way down. By the way that would be me interviewing. We got these people's number. The numbers up. My favorite one is the person. Been saying to buy tesla all the way down. It finally had a good rally. Gets on the tube. Gives himself a pat on the back. Even though we was telling me to buy it 400 $35,300 25200. We call that the broken clock syndrome. And we also call it the charlatans syndrome. We hate charlatans in this business. And there's a lot of them. And if you don't know what a charlatan is. I put it away they simply pretend to be something they are not. That's all. So good day. And the nasdaq was down. Good day. S&p was up in measly four points. Good day the dow was up 100 which doesn't mean a lot to us. It's where it was and where it finished. That's what we define. As a good day. Now friday starts. Massive amounts. Of reports. Not number but names. On friday. Jp morgan. Wells fargo city group black rock. Pnc bank. And the most important. Down. Because of price because it's price weighted united health up at 515 name will be reporting. Estimates it to be up about 11% in earnings. They usually beat. We'll see what that means. The managed care stocks have been very weak until medicare decided to give them a crap load of money. In the latest style you know every year they come out okay this is what we're going to pay you. By the way have you ever been in hospitals these days. How big they are how you got gigantic they are. I was in one in lauderdale. In hollywood florida this weekend. Oh my goodness. They're like a city. These hospitals. How do they get paid. You got it. Think i'm in the wrong business. I should own hospitals or storage. Remember my story in college i had to put the in the summer i put stuff in storage and i told her buddy man we should. Start a business just storage. Damn what a doofus. The stock called public storage psa. Totally do a storage. It's been around since. Forever. That was seven bucks in 1990 it's a 300 today. Storage. Up next. This that the other thing or whatever else i'm gary that's the one only investors edge. You are listening to me please. So. There is. A lot of talk that. We're going to have a credit crunch. Our answer to that. Will let the market. Dictate policy. The market will tell us. If they're big trouble lies ahead. Whipping told. That we're going to have a big recession. If not worse. Will. The market decide. If we're going to have a big recession a deep recession. The market. Will know it. We're being told. Let the dollar is going to go by the way of the. Dodo bird. That noise has been picking up a lot in the last week. Interesting the dollar was strong today. We'll just watch the market. The market will let us know. If we the dollar goes by. The way of the dodo bird. We're being told oh i've told you. Burning stink. We're being told. We're heading into even worse earnings into a deep. Earnings recession. Will let the market decide. We'll just watch the market. The market will tell us. Everything we need to know. We're being told. Buy some. Inflation. Is going to accelerate. And of course oil prices have backed up a little bit. Went up a little bit because of opec. If. Inflation gets really out of hand again. Really starts to accelerate. That means the fed's going to have to continue to do what they're doing. And probably means trouble for the market. But. Will at the market decide. The market will tell us everything we need to know. If the markets decide to. Croak. It'll let us know. As we will go into major downtrends. There are others. That are saying we're going into. A deflationary. Depression. No they are they're out there. Will let you know. Which is going to let the market decide. The market will tell us everything we need to know. We'll just watch price. And we'll just watch the market. There's not many people. Not tonight. We'll scan 15000 names. 200 sectors with sub sectors. Every country every commodity. Just to get a feel on what the heck is going on. We will. You know why we will. Cuz we want to stay. Ahead. Of the game. And by the way it's no game to us. That's why. It's quite simple. For us. We will work harder. And longer. And smarter. Then everybody else. In this industry. That will not. Guarantee. Wins or losses. It will guarantee. That will have a very good feel. I'm just what the heck is going on out there. And as always. Try to put our best foot forward. Simple as that. With no agenda. Bias. Ulterior motive. Will let the market decide. I have news for each and every one of you. You can't hide bear markets you know how you know you're in a bear market. Try buying something. You know how you're in a bull market. Sell something. And watch it keep going up. We try to simplify things for your kids. And it's still ain't easy. We have outlined road maps we did not invent it. We did not invent it some of the greatest technicians on earth. Did. We studied them. We studied under them. We studied with them. We learned. We learned from some of the greatest hedge fund managers. Like a pull tudor jones with one time he said these following words. I know many other people that have a better win rate than me. And a much better win rate than me. Then i. But. It's what i do when i'm wrong. That has me beaten their asses. I don't think you said ass. When wrong be wrong fast and be wrong small went right try to let him run as far as the ice can see. But gary haven't you sold something off. After losing a little bit and then it's skyrocketed oh yes. Full and fair disclosure. Some of my good wins though. We're buying something a third and fourth time. Cuz you never know when you're buying something it's just not the right time the right market. So what you have to do is be. Persistent. And stay on top and again. No bias. No agenda no alternative. You see what you see you know what it looks like. You looking at a photo album for familiar faces. And look what i found. And bill o'neill is famous. Gets asked about a stock. He'll say well it looks like so and so from 1957. And then you go look at the chart from so-and-so 1957 and yeah. That's how much time and effort that man put in. That's how much time and effort we have put in. And it's still not easy. These days we're dealing with so much more. Then we used to have to deal with namely. The interference of a select few people playing god. With our lives. At our future in the markets. With them moronic imbecile. Debt laden decision making. Power hungry maniacs. That's why. Every night. Regardless of the news. We put our head down. And we scan. With no agenda. Ulterior motive and bias. I can tell you flat out. If you just listen to some of the news right now a lot of the news right now. Hey taiwan's going to be invaded by china. That russia ukraine thing still going on. The list goes on and on. I have to tell you if i was just listening to the news. I have my head under the blanket and never spy another sock. But we know differently. We'll just keep paying attention. Markets are a treasure hunt. Very often you have to be very very patient with them. Bill bear markets will prey on your wallet. Also pray on your psychology. We won't let it happen to us. And we will not be influenced. By the perma bulls. For the perm bears. They are of no help. The perma bills are a no help in a bear market the perma bears are no help in a bull market. They never change their stripes so why even. Pay attention. We don't. It just shows up. Sometimes you just. In life. You see it. We don't react to them. We react to what the market tells us. Up next. News of the day. This is the one only investors edge. You're listening to you. And work once again to investors edge again thanks for being with us today. Are in the news. Unfortunately. It looks like a small bank in louisville and next employee went in there and shot it up. Multiple people. Are. One police officer. Shot in the head looks like a. I guess a suicidal louisville bank employee. I shot dead for co-workers. Injured nine others. He lost his job. I'm going to go murder people. Looks like i don't know whether he killed himself or whether a cop. Police officer took him down. As usual. The talk about guns pervades the air. We just want you to remember something and again we say this with no agenda ulterior motive in no bias whatsoever. Other republican side. Won't do anything. We already know that. But the democratic sign they're just full of crap. They've had ample opportunity to do whatever they want to do. Obama had a supermajority could have done whatever he wanted to do. Biden did not have one but he had. All. Parts of government. And the bully pulpit. What did he do. He did nothing. We just want you to remember that. The reason why the democrats won't do anything. And just flap their gums all the time. It goes back to why one of the big reasons they lost in 94. Was the. Assault weapons ban. That's what they blame on losing and they don't want that to happen again. Would just telling you. You go back and read it yourself. We're tired of both parties. And would particularly tired of any of them that flap the gums you know like joe mansion. The the supposed moderate that signed off on a 1.8 trillion dollar spending bill with $380 billion of our tax dollars going to one man john podesta a democratic hack to give out for climate. Joe manchester and now he's complaining he got he got lied to no no crap. So we just want to let you know every time you hear the gun thing. And just so you know i'm. I believe in. The americans' ability to defend themselves. I believe in that amendment. I really do. But. Nobody does anything. Let no movement zero. Nothing. Nothing. And we can get into it for 2 hours. Did you get my point. It's a fruitless endeavor of flapping gums. That's what it is a fruitless endeavor. A flapping gums. Remember this crime. They are outlier events. But. A death is a death. I will say a little. Prayer for. You know whoever reading about this a lot these days. In the news. I love how. Now. Everybody agrees with us. What are we telling you about bubbles. Who created. Oh wall street journal op-ed turn off the fed bubble machine that's the headline. Trying to ramp up applicant demand serves no purpose of supplies constrained the guy named andy kessler he's i guess he writes off beds for the wall street journal guess what he's telling you now we told you years ago. Got to get rid of the central bankers. They should not be able to print a 9 trillion bucks take rates to 0% and screw everybody. And then create bubbles and then the bubbles pop and everybody loses. So there's another person and now agrees with everything we've been telling you. For years. Seriously. In the news. Speaking of the fed. You know what they're doing some studying. Something that not even supposed to be involved in. The climate hoax. The fed is forcing big banks to produce complex reports. On their climate vulnerability. What. What. The san francisco fed host of the conference on climate change in may. 27 fat economist participated. You think they produce any research. High quality research. They did a couple of studies. My 12-year-old goddaughter to do a better one. The central bankers that have no clue. What's going on. I'm now getting at the climate. Feel better now. That was in the news. In the news. Did you watch the masters. I was supposed to go on saturday i'm so glad i didn't go it got rained out i would have been really po'd. John rom. Great player wanted brooks koepka faded. Phil mickelson end up second place. 52 years old. Was throwing darts at the end. Awesome. If you've never been to the masters and you like golf you got to go once. Just so you know what you got to get in the lottery to get the cheap tickets after that you're paying some bucks. Sandwiches are a buck 50 to 2 1/2 bucks they sell a million dollars of in their stores when you there an hour. What are most beautiful serene places on earth. If you are a golfer as you walk in to the place. You're mesmerized. So just letting you know if you never been there. Do it once i i've been there three times and i'm pissed off i haven't been there more. I'll be going next year. I still have never won the lottery though. I think i've been doing that for 30 years. That was the masters nba season the playins start in the next couple of days and then we go to the playoffs. Will be covering that and giving you some pics we're good at it.
